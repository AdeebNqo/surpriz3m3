#surpriz3 m3

The goal of this application is to surprise you. hehe, yes! suprize you.

##What

This application's purpose is to "randomly" exchange the music
on your phone or any device using bleutooth and/or a serial cable connection.

##Why

Some of us still use portable devices with very limited storage space for listening
to music on the go. However, our computers are filled with terabytes of music , so instead of buying
a memory card or another device with bigger storage capacity --- I say let's improvise.

This application should automatically replace the music with fresh new music from your computer
such that you don't get bored or tired of listening to the same songs. This way you get rid of the
burden of copying music from your pc manually.
